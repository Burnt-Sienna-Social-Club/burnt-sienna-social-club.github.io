# burnt-sienna-social-club.github.io

Code Louisville Front-End final project

A social club webpage, hoping to let viewers learn about different aspects of what the Club is about. 

Uses javascript & jquery functions in menu dropdowns, overlays, and picture slideshows

There is a multi-picture banner that used css grid that does not display well in IE or Edge browers. 

Made on chrome and works best in this browser

****unfinished features****
-seperate events page
-Overlay Functions: close when you click links, links are none active in overlay (contact form & dropdown)
